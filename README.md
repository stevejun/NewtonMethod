# NewtonMethod
  My implementation of the Newton Method using the Ideal Diode Equation
  
  Using the Ideal Diode Equation and the Newton Method, we can approximate the current across a diode as a function of voltage. We set a max tolerance tol and a max number of iterations n. The approximation from the Ideal Diode Equation is compared with the value of current from Ohm's Law.
